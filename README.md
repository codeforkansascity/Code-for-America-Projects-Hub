### Developer notes ###

See Getting Started wiki for help setting up an editor with Git https://github.com/codeforkansascity/Code-for-America-Projects-Hub/wiki/Getting-an-Environment-Started .

See [the Angular Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) for code structure (by feature) and "best" practice for writing services, factories, etc.

We're using [Bower](http://bower.io) for package management.

First, install dependencies with npm. The [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) file provides information to npm, identifying the project and managing the project's dependencies.

`npm install --dev`

This will also run `bower --install` for you, installing all packages configured within the bower.json file.

To exclude devDependency packages, use the `-p` (--production) flag.
`bower install -p`

#### Dev Dependencies ####
[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.2/introduction.html) 
is included to help with test-driven development.

[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/intro/installation.html)
is included For running tests. The project includes a karma.conf.js file. With Karma and Grunt installed, run Karma.
`karma start`

In your browser, visit the Karma listener address. Karma watches project files and continuously runs your tests as you code.
